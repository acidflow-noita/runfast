>Noita Together, or NT for short, is an attempt to bring a slight multiplayer aspect to the game, think of it more like everyone is in different dimensions yet you can still see other players and somewhat interact with each other you can not directly affect other player's worlds.

NT is an open source project hosted on [github](https://github.com/Noita-Together/noita-together/).
