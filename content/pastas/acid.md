> Its time to disclose the medical condition I have. I've got a strong acid reflex, which in layman terms means I'm unable to play Noita without acid spells, and upon seeing an acid spell my heart goes doki doki, my pupils dilate, the feeling of pain introduced by craving acid numbs, and sometimes all that gets accompanied by an involuntarily moan. It's safe to say that this condition is terminal and permanent, and I'm kinda happy. I love acid in Noita, its the only good thing about this game!
