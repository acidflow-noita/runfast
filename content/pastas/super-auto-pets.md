> Super auto pets is not even a game, it’s a collection of zoomers’ attempts to learn basic arithmetic. This “game” is absolutely unrealistic! Feeding dogs chocolate bars?! That’s animal cruelty. Have you seen a bus-sized ant?! The “gameplay” is by far the weakest point. The only good thing is the depiction of Satan’s face in the logo, the “turtle”,— I have seen and fought satan. 100% nailed his depiction. Overall 8.5/10 do not recommend
