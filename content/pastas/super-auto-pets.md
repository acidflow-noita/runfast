> SAP is not even a game, it’s a collection of zoomers’ attempts to learn basic arithmetics using pre school pictures for children, and failing horribly. This “game” is absolutely unrealistic! Would you ever feed chocolate to a dog? It will simply doe! That’s basically animal cruelty and torture. Have you seen an ant the same size of a bus? The “gameplay” is by far the weakest point: you just pray for pseudo random generator to give you a picture you want, and if it doesn’t, you lose. The only good thing about SAP is accurate depiction of Satan’s face in the logo, the “turtle”,— I have seen and fought satan, and i think devs did that too, that’sehy they managed to draw his face with such high level of detail. Overall,-1/10 do not recommend
