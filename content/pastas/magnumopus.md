The devastating airplain crash which took place on Tuesday last week. The retrieved black boxes seems to be intact physically but all the data is missing, which complicates the investigation process. Luckily, an old flip phone which belonged to one of the passengers, John Doe, survived. Forensics experts determined that it has been used to capture the last seconds of the doomed flight. While others tried to post their farewells and curses on Facebook and other social media and failed due to WiFi bein overloaded, The flip phone owner used the slowest 2G Internet connection to successfully transfer just a couple of dozens of bits of information. FBI's own cyber cecurity general Michael Twot personally traced the connection and was able to both recreate the entry and the destination points, as well as retrieving info on last action the passenger took, and his last message seconds before one of the engines hit the side of the airplane and decapitated him. Data shows, that Doe logged in his Twotch account, entered CVNKA's broadcast chat channel, and redeemed "Give me a lil pin" "reward" while providing an imgur link to the media you are about to see. Sotheby's announced that they will hold a charity auction in order to raise both public awareness and help the deceisd' relatives. It is expected that the flip phone and Doe's last message printed on a cordrum glass will attract the highest bidders. All the channel points raised during the auction will go towards printing it on the finest Japanese hand made paper and sending it to the world's most powerful coiuntries' leaders. Only 4 copies will be made. Nicaraguan State Airlines issued a statement sayingL: "We are shocked by the catastrphy and will do our best so nothing bad ever happens i nthe air transportation industry from now on, like, ever, ok?" We almost ran out of space to include the link to the rescued media. Here it is: https://pastebin.com/tgEcyPqU
