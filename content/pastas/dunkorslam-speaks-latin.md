> When chase has been working at the library he was curious and decided to find the oldest book they had. The book was massive, very beautifully crafted, and looked absolutely ancient. Even more curious, Chase opened the book, flipping through the pages. He saw many words written in a language he couldn’t understand but ONE word caught his attention, it was calling to dunk, it sang to him, it spoke HIS language. The word was IACTARE, suddenlythe realization struck him. Chase knew what he needed to do. Thats the story of how one latin word determined dunks whole life.
