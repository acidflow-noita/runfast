> Cowofdoom: “Wuote is like a ship passing in the night. You don't know where they are coming from or going to. You don't know what their intentions are and you certainly don't understand what they are saying. But in that one singular moment when your lives cross, you perceive the fleeting beauty of wuote, before they vanish into the dark.”
