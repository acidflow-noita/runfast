Major Noita streamers like DunkOrSlam, Aliasbot, FuryForged, Letaali use the Streamer Wands mod, here's what DunkOrSlam's viewers will see, for example, by typing !wands command in his chat: [https://onlywands.com/streamer/dunkorslam](https://onlywands.com/streamer/dunkorslam). Your link will be [https://onlywands.com/streamer/cohhcarnage](https://onlywands.com/streamer/cohhcarnage) after you get it working.

### Unpack

Uncompress it and move the `streamer_wands` folder into the `mods` folder in Noita (Steam --> right click Noita --> Local files), mine is located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Noita\mods`.

{{< filetree/container >}}
{{< filetree/folder name=C:\ >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="Program Files (x86)" >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="Steam" >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="steamapps" >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="common" >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="Noita" >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="mods" >}}
{{< filetree/folder name="streamer_wands ðŸ‘ˆ" >}}
{{< /filetree/folder >}}

### Enable

Launch Noita, click "Mods", click "Unsafe mods: Disabled", click "Yes" (this is due to deeper game integration requirements), click on "Streamer wands" in the mods list so it shows `[x]`.

### Test

Test it: launch new game, open https://onlywands.com/streamer/cohhcarnage in your browser, drop one of the wands, the website should automatically update after a short delay, showing that you have only wand.

### Add chat bot command

Add a `!wands` command to your bot with something like "Cohh's current wands: [https://onlywands.com/streamer/cohhcarnage](https://onlywands.com/streamer/cohhcarnage)".

### Enjoy!

Have fun, run fast and throw hard!
