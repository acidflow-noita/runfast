title: 'Electrocution'
---

Briefly electrocutes the player without directly causing damage. Often doesn't do much, but at the right moment it can end a run.

Very dangerous when the player is over lava (e.g. from Lava Pit).

Being electrocuted around enemies allows the enemies to attack without the player interfering for a moment.
