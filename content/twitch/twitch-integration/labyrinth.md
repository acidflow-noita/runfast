title: 'Labyrinth'
---

Spawns a steel maze around the player.

A few walls are made of ice and can be destroyed. It collapses after a timer expires, with an effect similar to an earthquake, which can harm the player.

Since it destroys terrain, activating Labyrinth near an intact holy mountain can anger the gods.
