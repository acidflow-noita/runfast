title: 'Spiked Drinks'
---

Adds random liquids to all of the player's flasks.

Liquids such as polymorphine can be especially dangerous when the player doesn't notice (or forgets) that their flasks were spiked.

Some liquids will also react inside the flask, ruining certain potions. If the player is relying on an acid flask as a method of killing the final boss, certain materials will turn the acid into flammable gas.
