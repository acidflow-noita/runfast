Applies [Larpa](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Larpa) effects to all projectiles (from both the player and enemies) for a time.

Larpa modifiers create duplicates of projectiles. While it can make the player's attacks stronger, it also makes enemies stronger, and makes self-damaging spells (like bombs) more dangerous.
