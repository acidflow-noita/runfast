title: 'Spicy perks'
---

Surrounds perks in the next Holy Mountain with lava, enclosed in glass.

To take a perk, the player has to break the glass to get rid of the lava first.

If a [fungal shift](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Fungal_Reality_Shift) (e.g. from Tripping Balls) has removed lava, this option will likely be less dangerous.
