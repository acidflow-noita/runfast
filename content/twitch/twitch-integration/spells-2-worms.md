title: 'Spells 2 Worms'
---

Turns all spells into [Worm Launcher](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Worm_Launcher) projectiles for a time.

Worms from Worm Launcher boomerang back to the player, dealing melee damage. Particularly dangerous with rapid-fire wands.

Since worms do melee damage, they will be harmless with [Melee Immunity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Melee_Immunity).

If the player has [Levitation Trail](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Levitation_Trail), each particle of the trail is transformed into a worm, making it quite deadly.
