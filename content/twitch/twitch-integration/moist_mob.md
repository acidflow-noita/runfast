Spawns many frogs under the player. Frogs attack with melee damage.

Frogs are harmless when the player has [Melee Immunity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Melee_Immunity).

As with other options that spawn enemies, this can be a dangerous combo with options that modify enemies (e.g. Derandomized Enemies, Derandomized Enemy Attacks, Weebpocalypse, Steve Gang).
