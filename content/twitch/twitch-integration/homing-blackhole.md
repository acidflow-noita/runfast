Spawns a large damaging black hole that follows the player. It pulls in objects and creatures (including the player), and can fling loose debris, causing physics damage.

Can be deadly if the player is cornered. Other spells (i.e. regular [black holes](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Black_Hole)) and items (i.e. [Kuu](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Kuu)) are capable of pulling the black hole in.

If the black hole loses its homing target, it will start to move in random directions.
