Transforms all nearby enemies into [tentaclers](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Turso), or the [small version](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Pikkuturso) of them.

Dangerous to the player because of the risk of freeze melee. Mostly harmless with [Melee Immunity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Melee_Immunity). Being frozen can still cause the player to fall into something dangerous.
