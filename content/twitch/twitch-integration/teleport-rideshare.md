Teleports nearby enemies along with the player when they teleport. As with Teleport Beacon, suddenly moving a certain distance counts as "teleporting" regardless of cause.

Dangerous with other effects that teleport the player, and especially with the Teleportitis perk: after being damaged by an enemy, the player will teleport away, bringing more enemies with them, which can damage the player further, and so on.
