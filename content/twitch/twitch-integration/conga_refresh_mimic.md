Replaces either the heart or the spell refresher in the next Holy Mountain with a mimic version.

- [Heart mimic](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Pahan_muisto)
- [Refresh mimic](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Valhe)

The mimics will attempt to bite the player, dealing melee damage. They will not do damage if the player has [Melee Immunity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Melee_Immunity). However, the lack of healing or refreshed spell charges can still cause problems for the player.
