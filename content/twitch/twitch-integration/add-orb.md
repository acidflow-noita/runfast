Causes the player to pick up an [Orb of True Knowledge](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Orb_of_True_Knowledge), which grants the player +25 extra max HP (or more with [Stronger Hearts](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Stronger_Hearts)), and increases the difficulty of the final boss.

With each orb, the boss will gain HP based on [scaling formula](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Kolmisilm%C3%A4#Scaling), and can gain extra defences/attacks/resistances/immunities depending on the total orb count.
