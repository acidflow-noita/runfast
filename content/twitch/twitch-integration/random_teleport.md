Teleports the player in a random direction.

Can be dangerous if the player is teleported into enemies or dangerous liquids (e.g. lava). Teleporting into lava is quite likely when in the final boss area, which has a large amount of lava above and below.

If Teleport Beacon is active, the player will teleport to the beacon instead.

If Teleport Rideshare is active, nearby enemies will be teleported along with the player.
