Replaces one of the player's wands (not necessarily the one they are holding) with a randomly-generated one.

If the player has a good wand (e.g. Teleport Bolt), this can make their run more difficult. If they don't (e.g. early in the game), it might give them a better wand.

Can be dangerous (depending on which spells are randomly selected) if the player does not notice the wand being replaced.
