Adds some Monstrous Powder to all of the player's potions. Monstrous Powder spawns [bridge bosses](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Sauvojen_tuntija) when poured.

Since it can be countered easily by drinking some of the potion, it is usually only dangerous when forgotten or not noticed.

If the player has a water flask and catches fire, they have a good chance of unwittingly spawning bosses by pouring the flask.
