title: 'Bitter perks'
---

Surrounds perks in the next Holy Mountain with acid, enclosed in glass.

To take a perk, the player has to break the glass to get rid of the acid first. The acid can eat through the brickwork and anger the gods.

If a [fungal shift](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Fungal_Reality_Shift) (e.g. from Tripping Balls) has removed acid, this option will likely be a lot less dangerous.
