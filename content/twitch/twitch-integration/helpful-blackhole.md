title: 'Helpful Blackhole'
---

Spawns a Black Hole on the player, with a boomerang effect. The black hole itself does not damage the player.

It can pull in nearby explosives or flasks, and can anger the gods if it destroys the [right part](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Holy_mountain_triggers.png) of an intact holy mountain.
