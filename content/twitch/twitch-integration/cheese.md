title: 'Cheese'
---

Turns everything in a large radius around the player into cheese.

Explosives will be detonated, and portals will be deactivated if near enough (because the teleportatium powering them gets turned to cheese).

If near a holy mountain, the brickwork turning to cheese will anger the gods, causing [Steve](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Stevari) to spawn in future holy mountains.
