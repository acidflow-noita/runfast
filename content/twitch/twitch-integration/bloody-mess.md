Transforms all materials in a circle around the player into blood.

If a [Fungal Reality Shift](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Fungal_Reality_Shift) (e.g. from Tripping Balls) has transformed blood into a harmful material, this may be dangerous to the player.

If a source of electricity is nearby, the player may be [electrocuted](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Damage_Types#Electricity_Damage) if they do not have [Electricity Immunity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Electricity_Immunity).
