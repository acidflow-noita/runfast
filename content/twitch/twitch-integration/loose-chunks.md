Periodically causes a small chunk of material near the player to crumble, in a similar way to [Earthquake Shot](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Earthquake_Shot).

If a chunk of loose material hits the player, it can do a lot of damage.

Can be more dangerous with things that pull in the debris, like Helpful Blackhole.
