Spawns [Scott](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Skoude), the bigger, stronger version of Steve. Eats through terrain and can chase the player between levels.

If [Steve](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Stevari) has not been spawned yet, Scott may anger the gods and spawn Steve by eating through the holy mountain.
