Turns random circles of solid material near the player into Cursed Rock, and turns liquids into Poison.

Can cause a lot of damage, and prevents digging using basic digging spells. Spells like Black Hole or Luminous Drill are required to dig through Cursed Rock if there are no other ways out.

Can be very effective if the player is already trapped (e.g. from an earthquake).
