Triggers a [Fungal Reality Shift](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Fungal_Reality_Shift).

If the player is holding a flask at the moment of the shift, there is a 75% chance the material in the flask will either be turned into something else, or something else will be turned into the material.

A short visual warning is shown before the shift takes place. The same visual warning is used for Possess Wand, as a way of countering reflexes (switching to a wand when Possess Wand is about to take effect will cause the wand to be possessed).

Take note of what gets shifted - if acid or lava gets shifted away, it will neutralise ACID?? and Lava Pit.

Shifts have a 5 minute cooldown, so voting for it twice won't do anything unless it has been over 5 minutes.
