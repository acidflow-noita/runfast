title: 'Derandomized Enemy Attacks'
---

Makes all enemies use the same attack, chosen at random.

Can be especially powerful in early levels, where typical attacks are weak.

Voting for it again while it is active will replace the current effect, choosing a new random attack.
If the current attack is dangerous, it may be replaced with a more harmless attack.

If the nearby enemies are powerful on their own, changing their attacks is likely to make them less dangerous.

Derandomised attacks can range from very dangerous (e.g. [Circle of Acid](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Circle_of_%28Material%29)) to very helpful (e.g. healing spells). Most of the time, the attacks are not helpful to the player (but may or may not be more harmful than default attacks).
