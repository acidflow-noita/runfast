title: 'Hounds'
---

Spawns some [hounds](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Hurtta) near the player.

Hounds do melee damage, and so will be harmless if the player has [Melee Immunity](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Melee_Immunity).

As with other options that spawn enemies, this can be a dangerous combo with options that modify enemies (e.g. Derandomized Enemies, Derandomized Enemy Attacks, Weebpocalypse, Steve Gang).
