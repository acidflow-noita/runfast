> To be fair, you have to have a VERY high IQ to understand why Multitudes is better than Swiftness. The mechanics are EXTREMELY complicated, and without a solid grasp of Noita wand-crafting system, most of the interactions will go over a typical user's head. There's also Multitudes' innate spell/cast, which is deftly woven into its use, its sheer power of drawing EVERY spell at once, for instance. The Multitudes users UNDERSTAND and APPRECIATE this stuff.
