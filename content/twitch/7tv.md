{{< callout type="info" >}}
You are adding emotes to **your** channel (and removing them from your channel too, for that matter), you don't need to go to WUOTE's profile on 7tv.

Wand building is an integral part of Noita gameplay. There are more than [400 spells](https://7tv.app/emote-sets/64c6b5b7d5a34030d08eb201) in the game, and wand building can be a challenging task. Lucky for us, there are many skillful wand builders on twitch who can help you.

To easily see what they're suggesting and in order to make their life easier, consider using the emote set I've created with help from awesome members from the community. The emotes work great in combo with the [Streamer Wands](https://runfast.stream/streamerwandsmanual) mod.

You can now quickly add (or remove for that matter) all the spells as emotes using 7tv's "Origins" feature. The curated and always up-to-date emote set will update automatically if the game's developers add a new spell.

Here's how it works:

### Request access

Contact WUOTE (that's me) via [twitch DM (whispers)](https://twitch.tv/wuote), or via [discord DM](https://discord.com/users/790836281927663626) and say that you want to use 7tv Noita spell emotes.

### Access granted

I give you access to the emote set.

### Go to your profile on 7tv

Click on your name on 7tv in the top right corner, you will see `Your-channel-name's Emotes` set, you will be adding Noita Spell emotes to this set.

### Add Origin and Assign to your channel

Click the spanner icon {{< icon "spanner-icon" >}} and select `Noita Spells` in the dropdown, then select "`Assign to channel(s)`", then save changes.

### Enjoy

That's it! It might take 5-10 minutes for 7tv to reflect the changes, but after that anyone will be able to type something like `:ACID` and press `Tab` to autocomplete the selected spell name.
